# DESCRIPTION

Our game is a two-player cooperative adventure inspired by the classic Fireboy and Watergirl series. Players control two characters—Fireboy and Watergirl—working together to complete three levels.

Fireboy is controlled using the arrow keys, while Watergirl uses "W, A, D." The characters can move left, right, and jump, and their goal is to navigate obstacles, collect diamonds, and reach the exit door of each level. Each character interacts differently with the environment: Fireboy is immune to lava but can’t touch water, while Watergirl is safe in water but harmed by lava. Both must avoid green goo at all costs.

The game starts with a menu where players can choose to play, view instructions, or exit. If a character touches an obstacle they can't survive, it’s Game Over, and players can choose to retry or quit.

Teamwork is essential to press buttons, pull levers, and solve puzzles to advance through the levels. The game focuses on collaboration, problem-solving, and having fun!
